Hi, I'm Lou. Welcome to my little slice of the internet, where I write about
programming languages and other technology topics. I hope you'll stick around
and find <a href="/archive.html">something interesting</a> while you're here.

A little about me? Well, I'm currently a senior web developer at <a
href="http://www.econify.com/">Econify</a> where we do cool stuff with Ruby.
I studied computer science at <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/">George Washington
University</a> and <a href="http://www.american.edu/">American</a> right here in
Washington, DC.

Sometimes I put code up on <a href="http://github.com/ljsc">Github</a> and you
can also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/ljsc">Twitter</a>.
